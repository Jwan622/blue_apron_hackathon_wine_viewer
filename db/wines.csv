Carneros gets plenty of sunshine, but the most important factor is the cool air blowing in from the bay as well as the Pacific. This slows the grapes’ ripening and imparts the wines with a crisp bite."
157,Kōtuku,2015,"In 1973, Allan Scott took a job planting vines in a former sheep paddock—but there didn’t seem to be a future in the work. He didn’t know anyone in New Zealand who drank wine, or even where to buy a bottle. That vineyard, however, would spawn the wine industry in Marlborough—the world’s best spot for Sauvignon Blanc. Allan became a world-renowned viticulturist, and he knows the nuances of every vineyard in Marlborough. He knows a few wine drinkers now, too.",12.7,Stainless steel (no oak),Various,,,Kiwi winemakers joke their Sauvignon Blancs smell like “cat’s pee on a gooseberry bush.” The powerful aromas come from compounds in the grapes called pyrazines.,,"",,,3,8,0,,0,"Sauvignon Blanc is your go-to for any dish with goat cheese, which tastes creamier with the wine’s zesty acidity.

Each sip gets your salivary glands going, cleansing and stimulating your palate for the next bite of food.",Pale straw,"Marlborough is New Zealand’s largest, most important wine region. Most of the vineyards are planted in the Wairau River Valley, the soils packed with nutrients grapevines love. The maritime climate’s sunny, breezy days develop Sauvignon Blanc’s signature tropical-fruit flavors, and cool nights preserve the grapes’ bright, citrusy freshness."
154,Arco von Kammersbründl,2015,"The Baumgartner family started growing grapes and making wine back when Austria’s archdukes were often at war across their borders. All the while the Baumgartners kept their attention focused on producing complex, flavorful wines. Considering that judges in New York, Brussels and Berlin recently awarded gold medals to the Baumgartners’ wines, their Grüner Veltliner probably could have helped the archdukes settle their differences.",12.5,Concrete vats (no oak),Various,,,"Austrians love Sturm, a cloudy, semi-fermented white wine that’s sweet, spritzy and a great match for winter foods.

That’s the sign of a more full-bodied, higher-quality Grüner.",Pale straw,"Niederösterreich—Lower Austria, even though it’s in the northeast corner—is Austria’s largest and most prestigious wine region, comprising eight smaller, distinct areas. In general, Niederösterreich’s warm days accelerate ripening and cool nights preserve the grapes’ freshness.

9,Cristián Pino Belmar,2015,Cristián Pino Belmar was a star in Universidad de Chile’s agronomic engineering program. That’s why he had his pick of world-class wineries to work at—and was also invited to conduct vineyard research in California and Argentina. Education and experience confirmed for Cristián a simple rule for making flavorful wines: A vineyard must be at least 15 years old before he will work with its grapes. That’s why this wine’s flavors are complex and concentrated.,13.0,Stainless steel (no oak),"Volcanic, clay, loam, sand",,,Older grapevines have deeper root systems that absorb more soil nutrients—which means grapes with fuller flavors.

It’s carved into several smaller areas with unique soils and microclimates, each producing world-class wines. Wine critics are currently bestowing their 90-plus scores on crisp, fruity Sauvignon Blancs such as this, from the cool, dry Andean foothills."
11,Sea Shell Vineyard,2014,"The desertlike Paso Robles region is known for producing big, full-throttle red wines. And then there’s Sea Shell Vineyard, a small property planted by the Carter family in 2001 in Paso’s tiny Estrella District. Because Sea Shell sits atop inland rolling hills, it’s just cool enough for the Carters to grow Cabernet Franc—rare in the area. In their vineyard Cab Franc retains its elegance, making this a wine with both Paso power and European-style grace.",14.6,New and neutral French oak,Fine sandy loam,,,"Cabernet Franc is often added in tiny percentages to California Cabernet Sauvignons, to add complexity to wines that might otherwise have simple, jammy flavors.","","",,,7,5,6,,0,"Cabernet Franc is equal parts strength and smarts.

The Estrella District is at the extreme end of that diurnal swing, since it’s an inland, higher-elevation area where the sunshine is stronger and the evening temperatures are cooler."
7,Lucas & Lewellen,2014,"If you’ve ever found yourself on the wrong side of the law in Santa Maria, California, your hearing took place at the Lewellen Justice Center. But Royce Lewellen’s name is better known for wine. In the 1970s, he teamed up with Rotary Club buddy Louis Lucas, who was among the first to plant vines in Santa Barbara. Back then, the jury was out on Santa Barbara wine being in the same league as Napa and Sonoma. Today, the verdict is clear, thanks to Lucas & Lewellen.",14.6,Stainless steel (no oak),Chamise and Santa Ynez clay loam,,,"The Viognier grape arrived from its native France, specifically the northern Rhône Valley, in the 1980s.

They trick your brain into thinking the wine is sweet, but it’s actually dry.",Light golden yellow with green highlights,"Sunny Santa Barbara County is just a short drive north of Los Angeles, but breezes and fog rolling in from the Pacific make the region cooler than Sonoma, which is north of San Francisco. So Santa Barbara is paradise for the Viognier grape, which develops intense fruit flavors under the sunshine and retains zippy freshness from the cool air."
12,Zaca Mesa Vineyard,2014,"Zaca Mesa is a Santa Barbara wine trailblazer. In 1973 it became the region’s third winery—and the first to plant the Syrah grape. Zaca Mesa’s been making some of California’s best Rhône-style reds and whites ever since, winning multiple 90-plus scores and Wine Spectator Top 100 spots over the years. If you’ve yet to taste what all the excitement is about with Santa Barbara wines, this powerful yet complex red is the perfect place to start.",14.8,French oak,Chamise shaly loam,,,"Much of the cost of red wine comes from aging it in new French-oak barrels.

It’s a signature of the Syrah grape, but more spice flavor comes from aging in oak barrels.",Dark ruby with pink edges,"Santa Ynez Valley is the largest wine region in Santa Barbara County. The valley runs east from Sta. Rita Hills, a cool, Pinot-centric area near the coast, exposed to Pacific breezes. Santa Ynez is significantly warmer, and home to fuller-style reds such as Syrah. The 2014 vintage was stellar, so collectors snapped up many Santa Ynez reds quickly."
147,Bodegas VQ,2015,"If you were a Spanish wine merchant in the early 1600s, your business-travel accommodations were ventas— little roadside inns where you’d buy, sell or trade wine. The Bodegas Finca Venta de Don Quixote estate, Bodegas VQ for short, occupies the same site as a Cervantes-era venta.

They’re what make Grenache a versatile pairing with meat and fish alike. It won’t overpower either.",Purple Garnet,"La Mancha is the largest wine region in Europe.

It took modern technology—temperature-controlled, stainless-steel tanks—for La Mancha to achieve a reputation for superb-quality wines, a couple thousand years after Roman settlers first planted vines here."
